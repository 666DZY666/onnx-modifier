# Introduction

To edit an ONNX model, One common way is to visualize the model graph, and edit it using ONNX Python API. This works fine. However, we have to code to edit, then visualize to check. The two processes may iterate for many times, which is time-consuming.

What if we have a tool, which allow us **edit and preview the editing effect in a totally visualization fashion**? Then `onnx-modifier` comes. With it, we can focus on editing the model graph in the visualization pannel. Finally, all editing information will be summarized and  processed by Python ONNX automatically. Most importantly, our time will be saved!

`onnx-modifier` is built based on the popular network viewer [netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) and the lightweight web application framework [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask). 

Currently, the following editing operations are supported:

- Delete a single node.
- Delete a node and all the nodes rooted with it.
- Recover/Reset a node.

Hope it helps!

# Get started

Install the require Python packages by

```bash
pip install onnx
pip install flask
```

Then run

```bash
python app.py
```

Click the url in the output info generated by flask (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/` for example), then `onnx-modifier` will be launched in the web browser. 

Click `Open Model...` to upload the onnx model to edit. The model will be parsed and show on the page.
